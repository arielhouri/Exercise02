# Exercise02
### by Ariel Houri & Yonatan Semidubersky

In this assignment we implemented two programs, and combined them with the Classifier that we created in the first exercise. The first program that we created is a Client program, and the second is a Server program.
The Client is in charge of gethering the data about the unclassified irises from a given path and sending it to the Server (Using TCP). After the Client gets the classified data back from the Server, it needs to save it to a given path.
The Server's task is to get the data from the Client (using TCP that we implemented in the Server's code), classify it (using the classifier that we implemented in the first assignment with an euclidean metric) and send it back to the user.
